    "project name":"Resorce optimization App",
    "business description":"In this project, the client's need was to optimize the maintenance of internal structures in industrial plants, reducing costs with materials and labor. The application takes as input the sizes of the materials to be used and the size of the space to be filled, returning a list of possible configurations that could optimize resource usage.",
    "technical description":"The application was developed in Flutter with a layered architecture and using MobX for state management. The app's premise was to have a user-friendly interface and not freeze during calculations, providing a good user experience. Therefore, asynchronous calls and loading screens were used to ensure that the user understood everything that was happening. For access management, the Azure Activity Directory and Figma were used to build prototypes.",
    "Work Methodology":"For the development of this project, we first conducted validations regarding the calculation to see if it would be possible to perform within the system, and we also conducted a design sprint to understand the client's needs. Prototypes were then built, and development was initiated. We used the Scrum methodology with two-week sprints for each part of the application, so that the first version of the app could be completed by the end of the project.",
    "my learnings":"During the development of this project, I acquired valuable knowledge about clean architecture and how to ensure consistency in the user experience. I had the opportunity to work in partnership with a more experienced developer and absorb a great deal of information. In addition, I improved my understanding of the context and dynamics of work within an industry. This experience allowed me to grow both professionally and personally, and I will apply these learnings in future projects."
