    "How I work 1":"I am a person who works with technology and is also passionate about business. I believe that technology is capable of taking a business to a more professional, reliable, and scalable level, as long as there are well-structured processes and internal organization. That's why I always seek to improve my knowledge in these two fields, so I can offer innovative and efficient solutions to the companies I work with.",
    "How I work 2":"This way, the process of building a project starts with understanding the problem and defining the objective. Then, solution possibilities are raised and the best ideas are evaluated, considering risks, costs, and chances of success. In the fourth phase, a prototype is built to test the idea. These initial stages were designed to be quick and efficient, allowing for solutions to complex problems in a short amount of time, and then moving on to development.",
    "How I work 3":"Software development is incremental, that is, done in stages. Each stage adds functionality or improvements to the previous version of the software, allowing for evaluation of the product and deciding which features or improvements are needed for the next stage. At the end of each stage, there is a testable version to receive feedback from users and address issues or add features for the next stage. This agile approach allows development teams to respond to user and business needs efficiently, adjusting to market demands over time.",
