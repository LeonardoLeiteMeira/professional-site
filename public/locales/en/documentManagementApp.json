    "project name":"Document Management App",
    "business description":"This project emerged in the context of the founding of a junior company, where we had many difficulties in managing the documents necessary to structure the company. Therefore, we sought legal advice to support us in building an application that could help other junior companies with their documentation. The project includes the description of the necessary documents, checklists, and filled-in examples.",
    "technical description":"The application was built using Flutter, with the inclusion of the presented documents and templates within the app itself. We used a Flutter Bloc architecture with an initial team of 4 people. The project did not present significant technical complexities, as it provided some documents, descriptive texts, and checklists. For the internal database, we opted for Hive because it is simple and flexible. The main concern was with the documents provided to users, which needed to contain consistent information.",
    "Work Methodology":"To build this project, we started by listing the pain points we were trying to address and talked to other junior companies in the legal field to obtain the necessary information to feed the application. After clarifying doubts and gathering MVP requirements, we started development. We used a Kanban board to manage activities and documented what was done each week, both structured on Notion.",
    "my learnings":"During the development of this project, I gained valuable insights into the legal context and the complexities related to providing document templates for different regions. In addition, seeking knowledge to train a team allowed me to improve both my technical skills and people management skills. It was an enriching experience that allowed me to expand my understanding in different areas and enhance my professional skills."
