    "project name":"This Portfolio",
    "business description":"This portfolio was created with the aim of presenting myself more comprehensively for opportunities in the field of software engineering. It was designed to facilitate contact with potential clients and interested companies, providing information about me, my professional experiences, and the way I work. Through it, I hope to demonstrate my skills and competencies, highlighting relevant projects and significant experiences that contribute to my qualification as a professional in the field of software engineering.",
    "technical description":"My portfolio was created using ReactTS, Next.js, and Material UI 5. TypeScript was chosen for its static typing and code clarity. Next.js offers robust features such as image optimization and server-side rendering. The Material UI 5 library made the development and styling process more efficient and dynamic. The result is an attractive and easy-to-navigate portfolio for potential clients and companies interested in my services.",
    "work methodology":"To build this portfolio, I started by listing all the information I wanted to present, as well as the premises I needed to meet. Then, I created a prototype in Figma for both the mobile and desktop versions. Next, I organized all the screens on a Kanban board in Notion and began the development process. With this methodology, I was able to have a clear and organized view of the entire portfolio creation process, from ideation to execution.",
    "my learnings":"Through the development of this portfolio, I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of ReactTS and improve my skills in the major frontend framework NextJS. Additionally, I learned how to configure and utilize the Material UI 5 library in a project from start to finish. With these newly acquired skills, I now feel more comfortable and confident in developing high-quality frontend applications."
